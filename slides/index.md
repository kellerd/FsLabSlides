### Self Improvement with Data Science and F#
- Dan Keller
- daniel.allan.keller@gmail.com
- Introduction to FsLab, Type Provers, RProvider in F#
 - A few of open source offerings
- Recent Functional hobbyist.

---

### Why F#
- .NET goverment shop (it was already installed)
 - Familiar environment
- Mucking about. (Functional, Imperative, OO)

- 10x developer vs 0.1x developer

***
### Most of my apps
- Line of business
 - Not interesting
 - CRUD
 - Barely any business logic
 - Huge side effecting pages
    - DB -> IO
    - IO -> DB

---

### That one App
- Features
 - Not pretty
 - Not complete
 - Hack and slash
 - ~~Continuous Integration~~ Drop and rewrite, many, many, many times.

### My "One App" is not
- Isn't the greatest thing written in F#.
 - Until recently it wasn't
 - F# Mentorship program
- I don't know if I should show it to you.

---
### Current release
- Basic personal time tracker

### Stretch Goals
- Kanban board
 - HTML and CSS are boring
 - Functional much more interesting

---

### Goals
- Project for learning
- Testing different frameworks, technologies
 - Things I can't use at work
 - D3
 - Angular
 - C# REST 
 - SPA
 - Browser storage
 - Local caching
 - NoSQL
 - Azure
 - ... Everything else 2 years old

---

### I know. Pretty bad.
 - Mostly backend
 - Very personal
 - Data

***
### Demo Tools

- [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Cross platform, lightweight, free
- [Ionide](http://ionide.io/) plugin for F# awesomeness
- Paket, F# package manager. Nuget only goes so far, paket does nuget + much more

***

### Lessons 1
- Spike in work from my Airbrush. Makes me more efficient?
- The things I like to complete

- Change the way I paint. Assembly line
- Start painting models for people

***

### Lessons 2
- Use, relearn, find new statistics exploratively
- No need to learn D3 again! 
- What's missing?
